# etch-a-sketch

This project is a challenging step up from the previous projects on this page.  The goals for this project are:
  1. To create an Etch-A-Sketch app from CSS and Flexbox (NOT Grid)
  2. To learn how to combine CSS and Javascript to dynamically change squares in a grid
  3. To troubleshoot flex/cascade issues that come up during coding
  4. To write Javascript code that can take user inputs for a custom grid
